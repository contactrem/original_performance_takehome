**Learning:** This is a custom VLIW SIMD architecture simulator written in Python. The goal is to optimize a kernel function in `perf_takehome.py` using this architecture.
**Action:** Focus on understanding the ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) provided in `problem.py` and optimize the `KernelBuilder.build_kernel` method. The architecture has limits on operations per cycle (`SLOT_LIMITS`).
